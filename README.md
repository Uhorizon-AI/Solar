> 🧪 Beta: Solar is under active development. Expect fast iteration and frequent improvements.

Solar is an open-source framework for multi-AI operations by context, built with a Hub-and-Spoke model:

- `Sun`: your personal router and context holder.
- `Planets`: autonomous domain workspaces with their own rules.

Solar is not only for developers. It is designed for founders, operators, and non-technical teams who need clear execution across contexts.

Solar is created by [@louisjimenezp](https://github.com/louisjimenezp) and maintained by [Uhorizon AI](https://uhorizon.ai).

## 🌞 Why Solar

A single assistant does not handle real context boundaries well. Solar separates domains by design so each context can evolve with clear governance, memory, and execution rules across multiple AI systems.

## 🧰 Recommended Setup (Best Experience)

To get the best experience with Solar, use:

- One AI coding client:
  - 🤖 Claude Code
  - 🤖 Codex
  - 🤖 Gemini
- 🖥️ VS Code as your main interface.
- Relevant VS Code extensions for your selected client (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini Code) so you can interact with multiple AI workflows directly against this repository.

## ⚡ What You Can Do with Solar

- Keep one personal command center (`Sun`) and route tasks to specialized domain workspaces (`Planets`).
- Enforce different governance rules per domain without mixing context.
- Operate multiple AI clients (Claude, Codex, Gemini) within one consistent operating model.
- Reuse common templates, contracts, and skills across projects.
- Scale from solo workflows to multi-project operations.

## 🧭 Example Use Cases

- Founder operations: sales outreach, content planning, and delivery coordination in separate planets.
- Agency model: one planet per client with independent memory, governance, and execution boundaries.
- Product + business split: keep engineering, go-to-market, and internal operations in distinct contexts.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Uhorizon-AI/Solar.git
```
2. Open Visual Studio Code, open this repository, and say `hello`.

## 🛰️ How It Works

1. You request a task to the Sun.
2. The Sun routes it to the right Planet.
3. The Planet executes with domain-specific governance.
4. The Planet returns status and next steps.
