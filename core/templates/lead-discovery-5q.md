# Lead Discovery 5Q Template

Use this script in the first call with any new lead.
Goal: qualify fast, map to a package, and define next action.

## Five Questions
1. What is the top business problem you need to solve in the next 30-90 days?
2. What process is currently broken, slow, or risky today?
3. Who owns this problem internally and who signs the decision?
4. What budget range and timeline are realistic for this project?
5. What happens if this is not solved in the next quarter?

## Qualification Scoring (0-10)
- Urgency (0-2): low, medium, high.
- Business impact (0-2): minor, relevant, critical.
- Decision clarity (0-2): unclear owner, partial owner, clear decision maker.
- Budget fit (0-2): below fit, possible fit, clear fit.
- Implementation readiness (0-2): blocked, partial, ready.
