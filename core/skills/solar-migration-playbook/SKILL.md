  Plan and execute migrations of existing folders/repos into Solar architecture

# Solar Migration Playbook

## Purpose

Define a practical, low-risk process to migrate existing structures into Solar.
Focus on file-level mapping, phased execution, and validation per batch.
Avoid big-bang moves and preserve continuity of current operations.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User has existing folders/repos and wants to adapt them to Solar.
- User needs a clear mapping into `core/`, `sun/`, and `planets/<planet-name>/`.
- User wants migration by controlled batches with validation checkpoints.

Do not use for:
- New greenfield setup with no pre-existing structure.
- One-off edits inside a single already-migrated skill or planet.

## Required MCP

None

## Validation commands

```bash
# Validate this skill
python3 core/skills/solar-skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py core/skills/solar-migration-playbook /tmp

# Sync core changes after modifying this skill
bash core/scripts/sync-clients.sh
```

## Workflow

1. Collect migration input
- Ask for source path(s) and intended destination scope.
- Confirm migration objective and constraints (timeline, risk tolerance, critical systems).

2. Select migration mode (required)
- Detect whether source contains `.git`.
- If `.git` is present, default recommendation is `in-place`:
  - keep repository history,
  - apply changes directly in source repo,
  - review diffs before commit.
- Alternative mode is `copy-import`:
  - copy content into Solar structure,
  - useful for sandbox/testing or non-git sources,
  - does not preserve original git history.
- Ask user to confirm selected mode before file edits.

3. Build inventory
- Create a concise list of top-level folders/files per source.
- Tag each item as: reusable framework, personal runtime, or domain-specific.

4. Apply planet boundary gate (required)
- Treat each `planet` as an autonomous operational context, not a department/channel.
- Evaluate whether each domain slice belongs to an existing planet or requires a new one.
- Use context-boundary criteria:
  - objective/KPI,
  - stakeholders,
  - data/processes,
  - execution rules.
- Decision threshold:
  - 2 criteria -> evaluate split before edits,
  - 3+ criteria -> create/suggest a separate `planet`.
- Do not split by channel or isolated task type.

5. Map to Solar targets
- `core/` for reusable contracts/templates/skills/scripts.
- `sun/` for personal runtime context and memory.
- `planets/<planet-name>/` for domain-specific assets.
- Do not store user-specific migration outputs in `core/`.
- If a source item mixes contexts, mark it as `split-required` and migrate only scoped slices (no 1:1 move of mixed folders).

6. Define migration batches
- Batch 1: critical day-to-day paths.
- Batch 2: automations and integrations.
- Batch 3: cleanup and standardization.

7. Execute one batch at a time
- Apply only scoped changes for the current batch.
- Report moved/rewritten files and deferred items.

8. Validate and close batch
- Validate expected runtime behavior.
- If workspace health validation is needed, run:
  - `bash core/scripts/sun-workspace-doctor.sh`
  - `bash core/scripts/planets-workspace-doctor.sh`
- Git checks are optional and on-demand; include only when needed:
  - `bash core/scripts/sun-workspace-doctor.sh --check-git`
  - `bash core/scripts/planets-workspace-doctor.sh --check-git`
- If a requested planet git check fails and the user wants git bootstrap, suggest:
  - `bash core/scripts/planet-git-bootstrap.sh --planet <name>`
- Record open risks and next batch entry criteria.
- Append decision log entries for each batch:
  - scope decision (`core/sun/planet`),
  - rationale,
  - risks,
  - next checkpoint.

9. Persist migration artifacts in the right scope
- Store migration map instances in:
  - `sun/migrations/...` for user-personal migrations, or
  - `planets/<planet-name>/migrations/...` for project/workspace migrations.
- Keep only reusable templates and guidance in `core/`.

## Output format

- Migration objective
- Source inventory summary
- File-level target mapping (`core/sun/planet`)
- Batch plan (1/2/3)
- Batch execution report
- Risks and next action
